# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your first steps with [Platformatic DB](/docs/reference/db/introduction.md). This guide will help you set up and run your first API using Platformatic DB with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional API up and running.

:::note

While this guide uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), Platformatic DB also supports [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). For more details on database compatibility, see the [Platformatic DB documentation](/docs/reference/db/introduction.md).

:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.8.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/) (v7 or higher)
- A code editor, for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Automatic Setup with Platformatic CLI

<NewApiProjectInstructions/>

### Start Your API Server

In your project directory, run this command to start your API server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your API server is now live! ðŸŒŸ It will automatically serve REST and GraphQL interfaces for your SQL database.

### Check the database schema

In your service directory - inside the `services` folder under the project directory (`quick-start`), open the `migrations` directory. This folder contains your database migration files: 

- `001.do.sql`: contains the SQL statements to create the database objects.
- `001.undo.sql`: contains the SQL statements to drop database objects. 

### Check your API configuration

In your service directory (under the services/ folder in the project directory), check the
Platformatic configuration file named **`platformatic.json`**
The environment file named **`.env`** in your project directory(`quick-start`),
provides the values for environment variable placeholders.

This generated configuration tells Platformatic to:

- Run an API server on `http://0.0.0.0:3042/`
- Connect to an SQLite database stored in a file named `db.sqlite`
- Look for database migration files in the `migrations` directory
- Auto-apply the migrations
- Load the plugin file named `plugin.js` and automatically generate types

You can learn more about configuration options in our [Configuration reference](../db/configuration.md).

## Manual setup

If you prefer setting up manually or need custom configurations:

### Initialize Your Project

```bash
mkdir quick-start
cd quick-start
```

Then create a `package.json` file and install the [platformatic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/platformatic)
CLI as a project dependency:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm init --yes

npm install platformatic
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn init --yes

yarn add platformatic
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm init

pnpm add platformatic
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure Your Database Schema

In your project directory (`quick-start`), create a file for your sqlite database and also, a `migrations` directory to
store your database migration files:

```bash
touch db.sqlite
mkdir migrations
```

Next, create a new migration file named **`001.do.sql`** in the **`migrations`**
directory. Copy and paste the SQL query below into the migration file to create a new database table
named `movies`:

```sql title="migrations/001.do.sql"
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

:::tip

You can check syntax for SQL queries on the [Database Guide SQL Reference](https://database.guide/sql-reference-for-beginners/).

:::

### Configure your API

Create a new Platformatic configuration file named **`platformatic.json`** in your project directory with the following configuration to set up your server and database:

```json title="platformatic.db.json"
{
  "server": {
    "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "3042"
  },
  "db": {
    "connectionString": "sqlite://./db.sqlite"
  },
  "migrations": {
    "dir": "./migrations",
    "autoApply": "true"
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Platformatic to:

- Run an API server on `http://127.0.0.1:3042/`
- Connect to an SQLite database stored in a file named `db.sqlite`
- Look for, and apply the database migrations specified in the `migrations` directory


### Start your API server

In your project directory, use the Platformatic CLI to start your API server:

```bash
npx platformatic db start
```

This will:
- Automatically map your SQL database to REST and GraphQL API interfaces.
- Start the Platformatic API server.

Your Platformatic API is now up and running! ðŸŒŸ

## Next Steps

Now that your API is up and running, it's time to interact with it using the REST and GraphQL interfaces. Below, you'll find simple examples of how to use these interfaces effectively.

### Interacting with the REST API Interface

The REST API allows you to perform standard HTTP requests. Below are examples of how you can create a new movie and retrieve all movies from your database using `cURL`.

#### Create a new movie

To add a new movie to your database, use this `cURL` command:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{ \"title\": \"Hello Platformatic DB\" }" \
	http://localhost:3042/movies
```

You should receive a response similar to this:

```json
{"id":1,"title":"Hello Platformatic DB"}
```
This means that the movie was successfully added to your database


#### Get All Movies

To fetch all movies stored in your database, use the following command

```bash
curl http://localhost:3042/movies
```

The response will be an array containing all the movies:

```json
[{"id":1,"title":"Hello Platformatic DB"}]
```

:::tip

For a comprehensive list of available routes and operations, refer to the [REST API reference](/docs/reference/sql-openapi/introduction.md)

#### Exploring API Documentation with Swagger

You can access the Swagger UI to explore detailed documentation for your REST API at:

[http://localhost:3042/documentation](http://localhost:3042/documentation)

### Interacting with the GraphQL Interface

Open [http://localhost:3042/graphiql](http://localhost:3042/graphiql) in your
web browser to explore the GraphQL interface of your API.

Run the query below to retrieve all movies:

```graphql
query {
  movies {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

:::tip

Learn more about your API's GraphQL interface in the
[GraphQL API reference](../packages/sql-graphql/overview.md).
